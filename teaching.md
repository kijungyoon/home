<h3>1. Probabilistic Graphical Models</h3>
<p>Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) can efficiently represent the structure of many complex data and processes by making explicit conditional independences among random variables. We use PGMs as an adequate generative structure (inductive biases), allowing for rich integration into more complex systems.</p>
